abstract = {Background National levels of personal health-care access and quality can be approximated by measuring mortality rates from causes that should not be fatal in the presence of effective medical care (ie, amenable mortality). Previous analyses of mortality amenable to health care only focused on high-income countries and faced several methodological challenges. In the present analysis, we use the highly standardised cause of death and risk factor estimates generated through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to improve and expand the quantification of personal health-care access and quality for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. Methods We mapped the most widely used list of causes amenable to personal health care developed by Nolte and McKee to 32 GBD causes. We accounted for variations in cause of death certification and misclassifications through the extensive data standardisation processes and redistribution algorithms developed for GBD. To isolate the effects of personal health-care access and quality, we risk-standardised cause-specific mortality rates for each geography-year by removing the joint effects of local environmental and behavioural risks, and adding back the global levels of risk exposure as estimated for GBD 2015. We employed principal component analysis to create a single, interpretable summary measure–the Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index–on a scale of 0 to 100. The HAQ Index showed strong convergence validity as compared with other health-system indicators, including health expenditure per capita (r=0{\textperiodcentered}88), an index of 11 universal health coverage interventions (r=0{\textperiodcentered}83), and human resources for health per 1000 (r=0{\textperiodcentered}77). We used free disposal hull analysis with bootstrapping to produce a frontier based on the relationship between the HAQ Index and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a measure of overall development consisting of income per capita, average years of education, and total fertility rates. This frontier allowed us to better quantify the maximum levels of personal health-care access and quality achieved across the development spectrum, and pinpoint geographies where gaps between observed and potential levels have narrowed or widened over time. Findings Between 1990 and 2015, nearly all countries and territories saw their HAQ Index values improve; nonetheless, the difference between the highest and lowest observed HAQ Index was larger in 2015 than in 1990, ranging from 28{\textperiodcentered}6 to 94{\textperiodcentered}6. Of 195 geographies, 167 had statistically significant increases in HAQ Index levels since 1990, with South Korea, Turkey, Peru, China, and the Maldives recording among the largest gains by 2015. Performance on the HAQ Index and individual causes showed distinct patterns by region and level of development, yet substantial heterogeneities emerged for several causes, including cancers in highest-SDI countries; chronic kidney disease, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections among middle-SDI countries; and measles and tetanus among lowest-SDI countries. While the global HAQ Index average rose from 40{\textperiodcentered}7 (95{\%} uncertainty interval, 39{\textperiodcentered}0–42{\textperiodcentered}8) in 1990 to 53{\textperiodcentered}7 (52{\textperiodcentered}2–55{\textperiodcentered}4) in 2015, far less progress occurred in narrowing the gap between observed HAQ Index values and maximum levels achieved; at the global level, the difference between the observed and frontier HAQ Index only decreased from 21{\textperiodcentered}2 in 1990 to 20{\textperiodcentered}1 in 2015. If every country and territory had achieved the highest observed HAQ Index by their corresponding level of SDI, the global average would have been 73{\textperiodcentered}8 in 2015. Several countries, particularly in eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa, reached HAQ Index values similar to or beyond their development levels, whereas others, namely in southern sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia, lagged behind what geographies of similar development attained between 1990 and 2015. Interpretation This novel extension of the GBD Study shows the untapped potential for personal health-care access and quality improvement across the development spectrum. Amid substantive advances in personal health care at the national level, heterogeneous patterns for individual causes in given countries or territories suggest that few places have consistently achieved optimal health-care access and quality across health-system functions and therapeutic areas. This is especially evident in middle-SDI countries, many of which have recently undergone or are currently experiencing epidemiological transitions. The HAQ Index, if paired with other measures of health-system},

No country retained the same position. Rankings for southern European countries and Japan, which had performed well in the report, fell sharply, whereas those of the Nordic countries improved. Some middle ranking countries (United Kingdom, Netherlands) also fell considerably; New Zealand improved its position. Rankings changed when ischaemic heart disease was included as amenable to health care.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The 2000 World Health Report has been cited widely to support claims for the merits of otherwise different health systems. High levels of health attainment in well performing countries may be a consequence of good fortune in geography, and thus dietary habits, and success in the health effects of policies in other sectors. When assessed in terms of achievements that are more explicitly linked to health care, their performance may not be as good.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported large socioeconomic inequalities in mortality from conditions amenable to medical intervention, but it is unclear whether these can be attributed to inequalities in access or quality of health care, or to confounding influences such as inequalities in background risk of diseases. We therefore studied whether inequalities in mortality from conditions amenable to medical intervention vary between countries in patterns which differ from those observed for other (non-amenable) causes of death. More specifically, we hypothesized that, as compared to non-amenable causes, inequalities in mortality from amenable causes are more strongly associated with inequalities in health care use and less strongly with inequalities in common risk factors for disease such as smoking.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Cause-specific mortality data for people aged 30-74 years were obtained for 14 countries, and were analysed by calculating age-standardized mortality rates and relative risks comparing a lower with a higher educational group. Survey data on health care use and behavioural risk factors for people aged 30-74 years were obtained for 12 countries, and were analysed by calculating age-and sex-adjusted odds ratios comparing a low with a higher educational group. Patterns of association were explored by calculating correlation coefficients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In most countries and for most amenable causes of death substantial inequalities in mortality were observed, but inequalities in mortality from amenable causes did not vary between countries in patterns that are different from those seen for inequalities in non-amenable mortality. As compared to non-amenable causes, inequalities in mortality from amenable causes are not more strongly associated with inequalities in health care use. Inequalities in mortality from amenable causes are also not less strongly associated with common risk factors such as smoking.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence that inequalities in mortality from amenable conditions are related to inequalities in access or quality of health care. Further research is needed to find the causes of socio-economic inequalities in mortality from amenable conditions, and caution should be exercised in interpreting these inequalities as indicating health care deficiencies.},

abstract = {Background: Mortality amenable to health-care services ('amenable mortality') has been defined as " premature deaths that should not occur in the presence of timely and effective health care " and as " conditions for which effective clinical interventions exist. " We analyzed the regional variability in health-care services using amenable mortality as a performance indicator. Convergent validity was examined against other indicators, such as health expenditure, GDP per capita, life expectancy at birth, disability-free life expectancy at age 15, number of diagnostic and laboratory tests per 1,000 inhabitants, and the prevalence of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Methods: Amenable mortality rate was calculated as the average annual number of deaths in the population aged 0–74 years per 100,000 inhabitants, and it was then stratified by gender and region. Data were drawn from national mortality statistics for the period 2006–08. Results: During the study period (2006–08), the age-standardized death rate (SDR) amenable to health-care services in Italy was 62.6 per 100,000 inhabitants: 66.0 per 100,000 for males and 59.1 per 100,000 for females. Significant regional variations ranged from 54.1 per 100,000 inhabitants in Alto Adige to 76.3 per 100,000 in Campania. Regional variability in SDR was examined separately for male and females. The variability proved to be statistically significant for both males and females (males: Q-test = 638.5, p {\textless} 0.001; females: Q-test = 700.1, p {\textless} 0.001). However, among men, we found a clear-cut divide in SDR values between Central and Southern Italy; among women, this divide was less pronounced. Amenable mortality was negatively correlated with life expectancy at birth for both genders (male: r = −0.64, p = 0.002; female: r = −0.88, p {\textless}0.001) and with disability-free life expectancy at age 15 (male: r = −0.70, p {\textless}0.001; female: r = −0.67, p {\textless}0.001). Amenable mortality displayed a statistically significant negative relationship with GDP per capita, the quantity of diagnostic and laboratory tests per 1,000 inhabitants, and the prevalence of cancer. Conclusions: Amenable mortality shows a wide variation across Italian regions and an inverse relationship with life expectancy and GDP per capita, as expected.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the contribution of health care to health gain, and to ethnic and socio-economic health inequalities, in New Zealand over the past quarter century. METHOD: Amenable and all-cause mortality rates by ethnicity and equivalised household income tertile from 1981-84 to 2001-04 were estimated from linked census-mortality datasets (the New Zealand Census-Mortality Study). Amenable mortality (deaths under age 75 from conditions responsive to health care) was defined using a classification recently developed for use in Australia and New Zealand. The contribution of health care to the observed improvement in population health status was estimated by the ratio of the difference in amenable to the difference in all-cause mortality over the observation period. RESULTS: Trends in amenable causes of death were estimated to account for approximately one-third of the fall in mortality over the past quarter century, for the population as a whole and for all income and ethnic groups except Pacific peoples, for whom there was no reduction in amenable mortality. In 2001-04, amenable causes accounted for approximately one quarter of the mortality gap between all ethnic groups compared to the European/Other reference. DISCUSSION: Our finding provides one indicator of the social impact of health care over this period. More importantly, that Pacific peoples seem to have benefited less than other ethnic groups calls for urgent explanation. Also, our finding that amenable causes account for about one quarter of current mortality disparities, clearly indicates that improvement in access to and quality of health care for disadvantaged groups could substantively reduce health inequalities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: There is widespread consensus on the need for better indicators of the effectiveness of healthcare. We carried out an analysis of the validity of amenable mortality as an indicator of the effectiveness of healthcare, focusing on the potential use in routine surveillance systems of between-country variations in rates of mortality. We assessed whether the introduction of specific healthcare innovations coincided with declines in mortality from potentially amenable causes in seven European countries. In this paper, we summarise the main results of this study and illustrate them for four conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA AND METHODS: We identified 14 conditions for which considerable declines in mortality have been observed and for which there is reasonable evidence in the literature of the effectiveness of healthcare interventions to lower mortality. We determined the time at which these interventions were introduced and assessed whether the innovations coincided with favourable changes in the mortality trends from these conditions, measured using Poisson linear spline regression. All the evidence was then presented to a Delphi panel.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: The timing of innovation and favourable change in mortality trends coincided for only a few conditions. Other reasons for mortality decline are likely to include diffusion and improved quality of interventions and in incidence of diseases and their risk factors, but there is insufficient evidence to differentiate these at present. For most conditions, a Delphi panel could not reach consensus on the role of current mortality levels as measures of effectiveness of healthcare.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in healthcare probably lowered mortality from many of the conditions that we studied but occurred in a much more diffuse way than we assumed in the study design. Quantification of the contribution of healthcare to mortality requires adequate data on timing of innovation and trends in diffusion and quality and in incidence of disease, none of which are currently available. Given these gaps in knowledge, between-country differences in levels of mortality from amenable conditions should not be used for routine surveillance of healthcare performance. The timing and pace of mortality decline from amenable conditions may provide better indicators of healthcare performance.},

Counts and standardized rates were calculated for 16 health regions. To assess reliability, sensitivity and validity, we compared rates across regions and over time, and examined correlations with premature and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Of the 238,849 deaths in the study period, 6.6{\%} or 13.7{\%} were classified as amenable (depending on the definition used). Rates were stable or falling in more populated regions, but unstable with large confidence intervals elsewhere. Correlation with overall mortality was strong.

The present study examines whether specific health care system types are associated with different time trend declines in amenable mortality from 2000 to 2014 in 22 European OECD countries.{\textless}bold{\textgreater}Methods: {\textless}/bold{\textgreater}A time trend analysis was performed. Using Nolte and McKee's list, age-standardized amenable mortality rates (SDRs) were calculated as the annual number of deaths over the population aged 0-74 years per 100,000 inhabitants. We classified health care systems according to a deductively generated classification by B{\"{o}}hm. This classification identifies three dimensions that are not entirely independent of each other but follow a clear order: the regulation dimension is first, followed by the financing dimension and finally service provision. We performed a hierarchical semi-log polynomial regression analysis on the annual SDRs to determine whether specific health care systems were associated with different SDR trajectories over time.{\textless}bold{\textgreater}Results: {\textless}/bold{\textgreater}The results showed a clear decline in SDRs in all 22 health care systems between 2000 and 2014 although at different annual changes (slopes). Regression analysis showed that there was a significant difference among the slopes according to provision dimension. Health care systems with a private provision exhibited a slowdown in the decline of amenable mortality over time. It therefore seems that ownership is the most relevant dimension in determining a different pattern of decline in mortality.{\textless}bold{\textgreater}Conclusions: {\textless}/bold{\textgreater}All countries experienced decreases in amenable mortality between 2000 and 2014; this decline seems to be partially a reflection of health care systems, especially when affected by the provision dimension. If the private ownership is maintained or promoted by health systems, these findings might be considered when thinking about regulation policies to control factors that might influence health care performance.

For England and Wales, data on occupational mortality from the Decennial Supplements of the years around 1931, 1961 and 1981 were used. For the netherlands, a more indirect approach had to be followed, using data on geographical variation in mortality for the years around 1952, 1962, 1972 and 1982. In England and Wales during the period 1931-1961 mortality from conditions which became amenable to medical intervention generally declined more in relative terms among the higher occupational classes, both for men and for married women. During the period 1961-1981 the picture was less consistent, although for about half of the conditions mortality declines were again larger in the higher occupational classes. The findings for the Netherlands suggest a similar pattern of differential mortality decline for a small number of conditions only. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed. We conclude that: {\&}{\#}x02022; -the widening of the mortality differences between socio-economic groups in England and Wales was partly due to differences in decline of mortality from conditions amenable to medical intervention; the same may be true to some extent for the Netherlands, but the evidence is not striking; {\&}{\#}x02022; -differences in decline of mortality from 'amenable' conditions were probably due, at least in part and at least up to 1960, to differences between socio-economic groups in accessibility, utilization or quality of medical care.

In addition, a sensitivity analysis of the amenable mortality indicator for varying age limits and attributional weights of circulatory system diseases is carried out. While large improvements were made in reducing amenable deaths in all European countries, great variations persist among Member States. Most of the decreases in amenable mortality are explained by a substantial reduction of deaths due to circulatory system diseases. In addition, even in countries with good national performance on amenable mortality, sub-national analysis shows that great regional disparities exist.

Studies of geographical variation have shown that mortality from amenable causes is consistently associated with socioeconomic factors, and that the association with the provision of health care resources is rather weak and inconsistent.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: (1) The low levels of mortality from amenable causes which presently prevail in industrialised countries are likely to reflect, at least in part, the increased effectiveness of health services; (2) geographical variation in mortality from amenable causes has not yet been shown to reflect differences in effectiveness of health services; and (3) if geographical variation in avoidable mortality does reflect such differences, they must arise from circumstances other than the level of supply, for example from more specific aspects of health care delivery, and are probably closely related to socioeconomic circumstances.

abstract = {Objectives: Using the concept of avoidable mortality, international studies suggest that healthcare has been effective in reducing mortality. This paper provides an analysis of avoidable mortality in Australia and compares trends with those of Western Europe. Methods: Using unit-record mortality data, we calculated avoidable mortality rates in Australia for 1968-2001. We partitioned avoidable causes into three categories: those amenable to medical care; those mainly responsive to health policy; and ischaemic heart disease. We used Poisson regression to model the trends. We compared trends with those of nine European countries using published data. Results: Total avoidable death rates fell by 68{\%} in females and 72{\%} in males. The corresponding non-avoidable death rates fell by 35 and 33{\%}. The annual declines in avoidable mortality rates were: 3.47{\%} [95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) 3.44-3.50{\%}] in males and 3.89{\%} (95{\%} CI 3.86-3.91{\%}) in females. For non-avoidable mortality rates, the annual declines were 1.09{\%} (95{\%} CI 1.05-1.13{\%}) and 0.95{\%} (95{\%} CI 0.92-0.98{\%}), respectively. In females, declines in death rates from causes amenable to medical care contributed 54{\%} to the decline in avoidable mortality rates, ischaemic heart disease contributed 45{\%}, and causes responsive to health policy intervention contributed 1{\%}. In males, the corresponding contributions were 32, 57 and 11{\%}. These rates, and the declines between 1980 and 1998, were comparable with selected European countries, with Australia's ranking improving over the period.
